I am currently an Assistant Professor (Research) at the Department of Computing at [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/), working closely with [Prof. Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Lei Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the ACM Honor Class at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) in 2018, advised by [Prof. Hai Jin](http://english.cs.hust.edu.cn/info/1296/1201.htm). 

Email and address: haoyang-comp.li@polyu.edu.hk, PQ810 PolyU. 

 

 **<font color="#CE1126">Position Opening</font>**
 
<font color="#CE1126">
 The topics of current research projects include large language models, self supervised-learning, adversarial machine learning, etc. If you are interested, please send me your CV and transcripts. Thank you!
 </font>


* <font color="#CE1126"> MSc students at PolyU who seek a dissertation supervisor. Please attach your CV and transcripts. </font> 


<!-- * <font color="#CE1126"> For PolyU undergraduates, if you choose me as your capstone supervisor, you will work on the most advanced AI work. But please note that hard work will result in a good score, while lack of effort, missed deadlines, or poor teamwork will lead to a lower score. </font> -->


* <font color="#CE1126"> Self-motivated undergraduate and master's students with strong coding skills (from PolyU, mainland universities, etc.), who are interested in our research topics, are also welcome. These students will be given priority consideration for PhD opportunities.   </font>


* <font color="#CE1126"> The PhD positions starting from  2026/09 or later are now open. The admitted PhD candidate will be supervised by myself and our department head Prof. Qing Li.   </font>
  

<!-- * <font color="#CE1126"> Self-motivated full-time Research Assistants (RAs) with strong coding skills are seeked. Part-time RA positions are NOT available. </font>-->

* <font color="#CE1126"> Self-funded PhD/MPhil candidates and visiting scholars are also welcome.</font>





<font color="#CE1126">
P.S.: I will personally mentor all students, including interns, RAs, and PhD/MPhil candidates. Additionally, I may invite other excellent PhD graduates to provide guidance as needed.
