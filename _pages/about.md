I am a research assistant professor at the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2023, advised by Prof. Lei Chen. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from ACM Honor Class at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2018, advised by Prof. Hai Jin.
